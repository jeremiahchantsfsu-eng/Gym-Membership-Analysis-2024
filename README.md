# Gym-Membership-Analysis-2024

<h2> The primary goal was to answer critical business questions regarding fitness performance, such as identifying which workout types maximize calorie burn and how demographics like age and gender influence gym habits <h2>

## Key Research Questions

- Workout Efficiency: Which workout type burns the most calories in the shortest amount of time? 

- Demographic Trends: What is the average age of gym-goers, and how do workout choices differ between men and women? 

- Health Metrics: Which workout types are most common among higher BMI vs. lower BMI populations? 

- Behavioral Patterns: How does a member's experience level correlate with their weekly gym frequency? 


## Technical Implementation
## 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Initial Dataset: Started with 1,315 rows and 15 columns.


Scrubbing: Identified and removed 341 rows containing "bad data," such as unfilled cells for BMI and weight, resulting in a final clean set of 974 records.


Optimization: Focused on attributes including Gender, Weight, Water Intake, BPM (Max, Avg, Rest), Session Duration, and Calories Burned.


## 2. Storyboarding & Visualization
The analysis culminated in four distinct visualizations designed to communicate specific fitness insights:


Vertical Bar Chart: Compared calorie burn across Strength, Cardio, Yoga, and HIIT, identifying Strength Training as the most effective method .



Slope Graph: Illustrated cardiovascular performance (BPM) and session duration by gender, revealing that male members generally maintain higher workout intensity .



Scatter Plot with Regression: Demonstrated a clear positive correlation between experience level and weekly gym frequency.




Table Analysis: Highlighted the direct correlation between increased water intake and lower body fat percentages.



📈 Final Results & "The Story"
The "Gym Membership Analysis" dashboard integrates these metrics into a single visual story. The data proves that while experience drives frequency, the choice of workout method—specifically Strength Training—is the superior driver for calorie expenditure and weight loss compared to popular alternatives like HIIT.




💻 Tools Used

Microsoft Excel: Data scrubbing, analysis, and initial graph generation.




Microsoft PowerPoint: Final dashboard design and visual storytelling.



Kaggle: Data sourcing.
